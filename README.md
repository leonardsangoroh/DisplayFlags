# DisplayFlags
Challenge 1 - day 23
A simple application used to view flags when their names are clicked

# How I Built this Project
The app was built thanks to 100 days of Swift course. On day 23 Paul Hudson gives us a challenge to implement concepts learnt to build a simple application.

# What concepts were followed
- The FileManager class
- Table views and image views
- App bundles
- Typecasting
- View controllers, storyboards, outlets, Auto Layout
- UIImage

# The following features/concepts were later built on top of the App
- Navigation Bar
- Add Button(s) to the navigation bar
- Save image(s) to the phone's photo library

# Screenshot of the application
